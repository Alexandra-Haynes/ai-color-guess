## Overview

This project utilizes a neural network to guess whether a color is more white or black based on its RGB values. Users can interact with the application to provide feedback on the AI's guess, helping it to learn and improve its accuracy over time.

## How It Works

The neural network is trained with initial data and then further trained with user inputs. When a color is displayed, the AI makes a guess and users can indicate whether the guess is correct or not. This feedback is used to further train the neural network.

## Setup and Installation


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Alexandra-Haynes/ai-color-guess.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ai-color-guess

# install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage


1. **Open the Application:**
   - A random color will be displayed along with the AI's guess.
2. **Provide Feedback:**
   - Users can agree or disagree with the AI's guess.
3. **Improving AI's Accuracy:**
   - The feedback is used to improve the AI's accuracy.

## Generating Reports

Users can generate a report by clicking the 'Generate Report' button. The report displays the number of correct and incorrect guesses and the percentage of correct answers.
